# electricity_billing_system
This project primarily focuses on calculating the number of units utilized by the customer and generating new Meter Information associated with a new customer.
There are two aspects of this application â€“ Admin and Customer.

The admin can create a new customer with new meter information assigned to the customer, view all customer details, and calculate the bills of all the customers. 
The user can create his own account after the admin has created his meter information and once the account is created user can view his account information.
Setup the development environment
Open NetBeans IDE and create a new Java project with the name ElectricityManagementSystem. Now create two new packages with the name electricitymanagment and icon. Inside the electricitymanagment package, we will create all the Java files and inside the icon, we will keep all the images for the project.
